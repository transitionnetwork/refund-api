The growing market in social investments and the limited capital we have available to invest means that we will target our funds to build a portfolio that will both further social justice and develop the social investment market.  We aim to hold a mixed portfolio and are unlikely to make a number of investments of a similar nature. We will only make an investment in a non-charitable company in the following circumstances:

    The social mission of the non-charitable company is in line with the aims of the Trust.
    Any private benefit arising from the investment is necessary, reasonable and in the interests of the Trust.
    Any private benefit is not excessive and the investment is clearly for the public benefit.
    Where there is the opportunity for considerable economic gain by the company then the Trust will benefit from that gain (e.g. by holding an equity stake rather than advancing a loan).

We are offering funding for projects delivering against the ‘Promoting Social Inclusion and Combating Poverty’ part of ESF, as this aligns well with our own mission and priorities. The funding will be delivered in Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) areas according to local priorities, which have been set by the LEPs, and could support projects ranging from improving employability for the most disadvantaged, helping those with multiple and complex needs, or improving financial literacy. LEP area partnerships have made provisional decisions about how much of their ESF allocation to devote to this strand of work, meaning that the amount of main funding available will vary widely across different areas.

Ahead of the main funding becoming available from 2015, Big Lottery Fund has awarded Lottery development funding in each of the LEP areas we are working with.
