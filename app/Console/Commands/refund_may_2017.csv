- Each phase leads to positive tangible results for the charity and increased impact for the young people that the charity serves.

Social investment is a different way of funding charitable activities. 
Since 2008 we have made over 90 social investments. We can commit up to £35m in social investments. We invest in a diverse range of organisations including charities, social enterprises, community benefit societies and other social investment funds.

How does it work?
Social investment is based on two key principles;

1. Social return – the investment helps to generate social impact and positive outcomes for people, communities or the environment.
2. Financial return – the organisation receiving the investment (a loan for example) will be able to generate sufficient income from its activities, goods or services to cover its costs and repay the funding over time.

We are an impact first investor, this means the social investments we make aim to achieve a high social impact as well as a financial return and be a good fit with our funding priorities.

Our social investments take a variety of forms, we work with an organisation to assess its business model and the type of finance needed to support the work in order to structure an appropriate investment. We do not have set interest rates or repayment terms; it all depends on the type of investment, what the organisation is aiming to achieve and what the social impact is likely to be.

We support both revenue and capital projects with social investment.
Our social investments include loans, charity bonds, equity, revenue participation agreements and Social Impact Bonds (SIBs). Our Jargon Buster explains these different types of investments in more detail.",1,England,NULL,For-profit,Loans,United Kingdom

Employment
Paid work is critical to tackling poverty. Whilst the clearest benefits are financial, work is also important in improving people’s confidence, self-worth, health and increasing independence. However, work is not always a solution to addressing poverty. Many jobs are low-paid, insecure, unrewarding and fail to act as a stepping stone into a future career. We are keen to address these issues.

Advice
Access to justice is unequal for the poorest and most vulnerable. Relevant and timely advice and legal representation is vital in upholding rights and ensuring fair treatment. We will fund direct advice work and representation in employment and immigration, particularly work which has the potential to have wider strategic impact and which offers innovative approaches.

Social Justice
We believe it is important to undertake campaigning work to influence government, other policy-makers, the media and the general public, if we are to tackle the root causes of poverty and inequality. This includes work to influence public attitudes, establish an evidence-base, as well as enhancing skills in campaigning and lobbying to bring about improvements.

Violence
Whilst people from all social classes and income groups can be affected by violence, our focus is on supporting those with limited financial resources. Our focus is on funding work that highlights good practice, provides specialist support as well as prevention work.

Small groups
We support small community groups as we believe they are often well placed to identify needs and potential solutions. We fund groups that have an emphasis on user involvement and self-help; which empower people to advocate for themselves and which build stronger communities. We define small groups as those with an annual income of under £75,000.",1,England,London,NULL,Grant,United Kingdom

A list of all LOs can be obtained from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) website. LOs have to be registered with HMRC to take part in the scheme. If you plan to receive money directly from LOs, you will need to enrol your organisation as an Environmental Body (EB) with us.

In England or Wales you can find a map of landfill sites in your area by looking at the Environment Agency website.

In Scotland, you may have to request details from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA). The LCF scheme in Scotland closed on 31 March 2015, further information can be found on our Scotland page.
